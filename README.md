# Masked-Face-Recognition

•   Amidst the Corona Time when everyone was forced to wear a mask all the existing face detection and recognition models become      
     useless,  to overcome this situation I have built a mask detector and masked face recogniser to help the pace of society.
•   I have constructed and trained the model using Tensorflow, Keras, VGGNET-16 Transfer Learning, OpenCV and CaffeModels.
•   I have prepared my own database containing faces of 12 persons and I have also made a seperate program to process the data for usage.
•   Achieved an accuracy of 85% on testing data and an accuracy of 98% on training data.
•   I have also prepared a program to see the recognition in real time camera.

For the convenience i have made two files ('FileToSeeTraining', 'FileToSeeRealTimeResult' - to see training process and real time recognition)
For accesing the dataset and model files (.h5) i have used for this model please go the drive link below.

You are requested to give any suggestions to improve the model or any other feature.
