# Masked-Face-Recognition

• Amidst "Corona Time," when everyone was forced to wear a mask, all the existing face detection and recognition models became useless. To overcome this situation, I have built a mask detector and a masked face recognizer to help the pace of society.

• I have constructed and trained the model using Tensorflow, Keras, VGGNET-16 Transfer Learning, OpenCV, and CaffeModels.

• I have prepared my own database containing the faces of 12 people, and I have also made a separate program to process the data for usage.

• Achieved an accuracy of 85% on testing data and an accuracy of 98% on training data.

• I have also prepared a program to see the recognition in real time.

I've created two files ('FileToSeeTraining.ipynb' and 'FileToSeeRealTimeResult.ipynb') for your convenience to see the training process and real-time recognition.

Please see the drive link below to access the dataset and model files (.h5) I used for this model.

You are asked to make improvements to the model or any other feature.
